<p>
	Jesper Lindius, a positive person who likes to drink beer, work hard and have fun. Some say he cant get too drunk. I dont know about that, all i know is that once i got the taste of beer on my lips i must and i need to have more. As long as there is beer at the table im going to drink it. Im not nothing of a ladies man so there will be no problem with me skipping the work for girls!
	I learn quickly, and is a problem solver.
	The most important part in my life is my friends what all i really care about.
